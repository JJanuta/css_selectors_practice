            <blockquote>
              A. clarinervium is a deep forest green colored plant with a velvety leaf surface, containing reticulate venation which is an uncommon venation pattern for a monocot. The veins vary between ivory or light green in color and are usually 1 cm in width. [2] It has ovate, deeply-lobed leaves, resembling a human heart, with whitish veins,[3] atop stems that are 1â€“2 cm thick.
